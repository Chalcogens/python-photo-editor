# python-photo-editor

Implemented a photo editor in Python that can modify the brightness and contrast of images. Additional features include adding blur, edge detection, and combining (overlaying) images. 
The files image.py and png.py are not original, and are taken from the tutorial "12 Beginner Python Projects - Coding Course" by freeCodeCamp.org, which modified the code from MIT 6.865 Digital and Computational Photography. The code I wrote is in the file transform.py, in which image filters have been implemented. You may comment/uncomment the relevant blocks of code at the bottom of the file. 

Files "city.png" and "lake.png" are the defaults read and edited by transform.py. You may replace them with any .png files of your liking.
